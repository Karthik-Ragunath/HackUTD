## GS Challenge

  - building co-relation between non-traditional fundamentals like social media chatter and activity, industry leader influences, trends/bubbles created by groups of retail investors etc, and their relation to performance of different types of asset classes including digital/crypto.
  - We would like the participants to develop an investment platform that makes investment recommendations and trading strategy by leveraging data available on historic and current performance of investment products and data available from various outlets on social media activity, sentiment, chatter, influencers etc.
  - You are encouraged to explore beyond the traditional metrics and research different ways this information could be presented as a critical tool, including possibly assigning ‘Social Ratings/Scores’ and tying this research to preferences that users might have based on their own investment history and risk tolerance.
